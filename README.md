Your first opponent <br>
His quick thinking makes him a Formidable Foe, by far the smartest although he only serves to teach<br>
The hand that guides is the first to leave

### Monarch

She lives to serve her people, only attacking when provoked, she sees the book as a game, without understanding the consequences<br>
failure to entertain will only result in your death

The veil breaks
